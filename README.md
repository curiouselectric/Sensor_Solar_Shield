Want to measure outdoor temperature and humidity? 

If you set up your sensor without a suitable enclosure, then it may not read the correct temperature â€“direct sunlight or wind onto the sensor can cause in-correct readings. 

A solar radiation shield like this one protects the sensor from direct sunlight and strong winds, while still allowing it to read the humidity and air temperature.

This is a little solar radiation shield has been designed for a AHT21 temperature and humidity sensor. It could also house other sensors.

This unit is laser cut from acrylic. It is comprised of layers which build up to create the enclosure. Screws at the top and bottom hold it all together.
